# Description: Aerospike Vector CLI Configuration File
# 
# When the --config-file flag is not provided asvec looks for this configuration
# file in the following locations: ./asvec.yml and /etc/aerospike/asvec.yml
# The "default" context is used when no --cluster-name is provided to asvec. To
# support multiple clusters, add additional contexts with unique cluster names.
# Then start asvec with the --cluster-name <name>.

default:
  # host: 127.0.0.1:5000
  # credentials: admin:admin
  # tls-cafile: ./ca.crt
  # tls-certfile: ./cert.crt
  # tls-keyfile: ./key.key

# cluster-2:
  # host: 192.168.0.1:5000
  # credentials: foo:bar
  # tls-cafile: ./other/ca.crt
  # tls-certfile: ./other/cert.crt
  # tls-keyfile: ./other/key.key
